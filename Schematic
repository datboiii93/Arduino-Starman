Couldn't get a real schematic to work, but here's my best shot.

Arduino Nano:
Pin D2 > MP3 RX output via 1k Resistor
Pin D4 > MP3 TX output
Pin D7 > Rope light output
Pin D13 > Button to activate Super mode
5V >  Button
      MP3 Module VCC
      Rope Light VCC
GND > MP3 GND
      Button (via 330 ohm resistor)
      Rope Light GND
      

DFPlayer MP3 Module:
(see link for schematic: https://wiki.dfrobot.com/DFPlayer_Mini_SKU_DFR0299)
Pin 1: VCC > Arduino 5v
Pin 2: RX > Arduino Pin D2 via 1k ohm Resistor
Pin 3: TX > Arduino Pin D4
Pin 6: Speaker 1 > - side of speaker
Pin 7: GND > Arduino GND
Pin 8: Speaker 2 > + side of speaker
*NOTE: If SD card will not read, try swapping RX and TX. Sometimes that was the problem.
